Recently, I've spent a fair amount of money on some not-so-important things, now I need a place to keep records in order to remind of being frugal and cautious on my daily expenses. Since i am planning to setup a blog to write about my personal life and professional work, this is just the right place to put it here. At first, I want to buy a VPS to host my blog, but after I've digged up some info about the VPS market, in which Linode seems to be the best choice, the price is kinda tricky for me now. $20/mo isn't that cheap as to my current salary. I also googled about free hosting services, mostly being unstable to some extent. Finally I narrowed down to Github Pages and Amazon EC2. I chose Github Pages over Amazon EC2 because it's much easier to setup with Jekyll Bootstrap and needless to care about the OS and LAMP.                                                                                                          

##Traceable Expenses (March~now):
1. Friend's Wedding:  1100RMB + 1621RMB(plane tickets)
2. Seagate HDD 3TB:  789RMB
3. Asus RT-AC66U Router:  870RMB

####SUM:  4380RMB
